# Overview

This folder contains a command line tool that can create "links" in the 
Symplectic database that runs the LBL Publications Management System,
using the Symplectic REST API.

## Purpose

At times, it is desirable to automate the linking of publications to
users (claiming) and publications to funding. Usually, authors/users
will do this manually themselves, but when we have access to 
accurate bulk data, we can use this tool to perform bulk linking.
